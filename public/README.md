# The Components
## Add to Cart Button/Image
On every page where you have a product, you will need to be able to add items to the shopping cart.  You do this by adding the following event handler to a submit button or image: **onClick="addItemToCartProxy(_nameOfYourProduct_); gotoCartOrStay();"**  This calls a function in the shoppingCartManager.js that is described next.  The function adds the product, as an object, to your shopping cart.  Please note that _nameOfYourProduct_ here refers to a product constant that is defined in shoppingCartManager.js and it contains the price, name, description and other details.  Here is an example, based on the default contents of shoppingCartManager.js: <img onClick="addItemToCartProxy(almondFlakes350g); gotoCartOrStay();" src="/payPalAddToCartButton.gif" alt="Add to Cart">
## Shopping Cart Manager
The **shoppingCartManager.js** script manages your customers' virtual shopping cart, including: creation, upating, deleting, reading, rendering and saving of the cart, items and products.  Mingled in with the JavaScript is some HTML for rendering the individual products and the whole cart.  The HTML can be customised directly in the script or exported to another file/template. You must define constants for all the products in your catalogue in this file, or adopt a method for importing them from somewhere else, e.g. a database.  The shopping cart is maintained in localStorage rather than sessionStorage, ensuring that it is preserved, even if the user logs off.
## PayPal Buttons
The **payPalButtons.js** script is used in the checkout page to render the PayPal payment buttons.  Take a note of line 29: **.render("#paypal-buttons")** this is synced with the next section and the contents of the checkoutPage.ejs, make sure that a change in one is also applied to the other. If the DIV mentioned here is not found in checkoutPage.ejs, nothing will be displayed on the checkout page.
## Visual Styling
The file **cardfields.css** stylesheet is used by all the frontend pages for customising the display of buttons and the shopping cart.
