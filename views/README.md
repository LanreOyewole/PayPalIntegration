# The Components
## Checkout Page
There is a single file in this folder: **checkoutPage.ejs**. Edit it, replacing the values for ClientId and currency. Refer to the PayPal docs for how to get your ClientId from the developer dashboard.
You can either copy the contents into your checkout page (my preference) or use it as-is from the server by setting the URL of your shopping cart to "your-web-path/checkoutPage".  The former gives you better control over the arrangement of your page, the latter allows you to hide your ClientId.  This page will display your shopping basket and the PayPal payment buttons.
